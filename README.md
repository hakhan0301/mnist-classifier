# mnist-classifier
A tensorflow.js based digit classifier.

## Getting Started
This project uses tensorflow.js, but since node_modules is not included in the repository, it'll have to be installed manually. The raw data is also not included, even though it is not needed, it can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/lorenmh/mnist_handwritten_json).
